        <li>2 russet potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Flatbread Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced hot green chilies (optional)</li>
        <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into very small cubes</li>
        <li>1 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To Cook and Serve:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot chili pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onions (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place potatoes in a baking dish, and pierce skins several times with a knife. </li>
        <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until very tender when tested with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, cover with a towel, and cool potatoes to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Turn oven off. </li>
        <li>Place flour in a bowl, and make a small well in the center with a fork. Pour milk, water, and salt into the well, and stir with a fork to form a shaggy dough. </li>
        <li>Pour in the 1 tablespoon melted butter, and continue to mix with a fork until dough begins to come together. Lightly flour your hand and knead in the bowl until the sides of the bowl are clean, and dough forms into a ball. </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough is smooth and slightly elastic, 2 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 15 to 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Measure out 8 ounces of cooled, cooked potato; add to a bowl and mash with the back of a fork, until slightly chunky or completely smooth, as desired. </li>
        <li>Add green onions, green chilies, mozzarella, Cheddar, and feta cheese and stir thoroughly to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Mash filling into a compact disc, about 5 inches in diameter, in the bottom of the bowl. Turn filling out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly, give filling a final shaping, and place in the refrigerator until ready to use. </li>
        <li>Roll dough out on a well-floured work surface into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Place chilled filling disc in center of dough circle. </li>
        <li>Working around the circle, fold dough up toward the center to cover filling completely, pleating dough as needed and using a moistened finger to stick dough together where it overlaps. Flour the top, and flip over so the seam side is down. </li>
        <li>Again, flour the top of filled dough, and roll gently into an even circle, 3/4- to 1-inch thick. </li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Gently place filled bread in the skillet and cook, covered, until the bottom is a light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip over, and cook, covered, until the other side is golden, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn bread back over, and brush top and sides with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. If flatbread begins to bulge, poke a small hole with a knife to release steam.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board and cool for 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir honey and pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Sprinkle flatbread with green onions, cut into wedges, and serve with spicy honey.</li>
    </ol>
